pkgxx OPTIONS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
pkgxx is a tool that builds native packages for your current
distribution.

reduce the work needed when porting applications from one distribution
to another.

pkgxx has modular backends to support various package formats, package
sources (aka.
repositories), build systems, and so on.
